# ðŸ§  Insider Threat Detection via Behavioral Data

This is a data science project that focuses on **anomaly detection of insider threats** based on employee behavioral patterns. The system simulates organizational activity and applies machine learning and deep learning techniques to identify suspicious behavior that may indicate security risks.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The goal of this project is to analyze various employee activity signals (e.g., printing volume, odd-hour access, foreign travel) and use them to flag potential insider threats. The project includes:

- **Synthetic dataset generation** with realistic behavioral features
- **Statistical analysis** and visualization
- **ML/DL model pipelines** for anomaly detection
- **Interpretability and evaluation** of suspicious behavior patterns

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, PyTorch 
- Jupyter / Google Colab
