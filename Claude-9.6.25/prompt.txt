I divided the metrics by alert types (these are the color codes).
Each field includes: data type, a Hebrew description, and notes.
All fields and metrics are at the employee-date level.

I've also added several smart indicators—composite features that signal suspicious activity patterns.

I verified with ChatGPT that it is valid to include static features in the same table; the model can differentiate between date-dependent and constant attributes, so the personal characteristics are included as well.

The file is attached.
I would appreciate it if someone could now continue from here and try to generate synthetic data for us.

It's recommended that at least 7% of users in the dataset exhibit malicious behavior, so the model can identify behavior patterns.

Instructions:

Please write Python code that generates a number of records specified by the user.
I trust you to write code that produces synthetic data as close to real-world behavior as possible.

The goal is to feed this data into a machine learning model.
Maintain a high degree of realism in the data — don’t make it too easy just to simplify the model’s job.

In addition to the data generation code (parameterized by record count), include:

An EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) of the entire dataset

A pipeline that trains multiple models on the data

Let me know if you'd like me to start implementing this in Python for you.
